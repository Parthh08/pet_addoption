# Pet Adoption App - GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Current Issue: Permission Denied Error 403 ❌

The deployment is failing with:
```
Permission to Parthh08/pet_addoption.git denied to github-actions[bot]
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Parthh08/pet_addoption.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

## Root Cause
GitHub Pages is not properly configured to allow GitHub Actions to deploy to it.

## SOLUTION: Follow These Steps Exactly

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (CRITICAL) 🔧
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Parthh08/pet_addoption
2. **Click "Settings" tab** (next to Code, Issues, etc.)
3. **In the left sidebar, click "Pages"**
4. **Under "Source"**:
   - Change from "Deploy from a branch" 
   - **Select "GitHub Actions"** ← THIS IS THE KEY FIX!
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Permissions ✅
1. **Still in Settings, click "Actions" → "General"**
2. **Under "Workflow permissions"**:
   - Select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Choose Your Deployment Method
You have two working workflow options:

#### Option A: Use the Updated deploy.yml (Fixed)
- ✅ Fixed base href to match repository name: `/pet_addoption/`
- ✅ Updated to peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
- ✅ Proper permissions configured

#### Option B: Use github-pages.yml (Recommended)
- ✅ Uses official GitHub Pages actions
- ✅ More reliable and future-proof
- ✅ Separates build and deploy for better error handling

### Step 4: Trigger Deployment
After completing Steps 1-2, push any change to trigger the workflow:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result 🎯
Your app will be available at: **https://Parthh08.github.io/pet_addoption/**

## Key Fixes Applied ✅
- ✅ Added proper workflow permissions
- ✅ Fixed repository name mismatch in base href
- ✅ Created alternative workflow using official GitHub Pages actions
- ✅ Updated deployment documentation

## If Still Failing
1. **Double-check** that "Source" in Pages settings is set to "GitHub Actions"
2. **Verify** workflow permissions are "Read and write"
3. **Check** the Actions tab for detailed error logs
4. **Try** the alternative github-pages.yml workflow
