# Pet Adoption App - GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Current Issue: Permission Denied Error 403 ❌

The deployment is failing with:
```
Permission to Parthh08/pet_addoption.git denied to github-actions[bot]
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Parthh08/pet_addoption.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

## Root Cause
GitHub Pages is not properly configured to allow GitHub Actions to deploy to it.

## SOLUTION: Complete Fix for Persistent 403 Errors

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (CRITICAL) 🔧
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Parthh08/pet_addoption
2. **Click "Settings" tab** (next to Code, Issues, etc.)
3. **In the left sidebar, click "Pages"**
4. **Under "Source"**:
   - Change from "Deploy from a branch" 
   - **Select "GitHub Actions"** ← THIS IS THE KEY FIX!
5. **Leave "Custom domain" field EMPTY** (unless you have a real domain)
6. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Permissions ✅
1. **Still in Settings, click "Actions" → "General"**
2. **Under "Workflow permissions"**:
   - Select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Updated Workflow (NEW APPROACH) 🔄
I've updated your `deploy.yml` to use the official GitHub Pages actions instead of the third-party one. This workflow:
- ✅ Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` and `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- ✅ Separates build and deploy jobs for better reliability
- ✅ Works directly with GitHub Pages without needing branch permissions
- ✅ No longer tries to push to a `gh-pages` branch

### Step 4: Complete Repository Reset (If Still Failing)
If you're still getting 403 errors, do this complete reset:

1. **Delete the `gh-pages` branch** (if it exists):
   - Go to your repository
   - Click "Branches" 
   - Delete the `gh-pages` branch if present

2. **Disable and Re-enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Settings → Pages
   - Change Source to "None" → Save
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Change Source back to "GitHub Actions" → Save

3. **Push the updated workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Switch to official GitHub Pages workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Expected Result 🎯
Your app will be available at: **https://Parthh08.github.io/pet_addoption/**

## Key Fixes Applied ✅
- ✅ Added proper workflow permissions
- ✅ Fixed repository name mismatch in base href
- ✅ Created alternative workflow using official GitHub Pages actions
- ✅ Updated deployment documentation

## If STILL Getting 403 Errors (Advanced Troubleshooting) 🔧

### Check 1: Repository Visibility
- Make sure your repository is **public** (GitHub Pages doesn't work with private repos on free plans)

### Check 2: Branch Protection
- Go to Settings → Branches
- If you have branch protection on `main`, temporarily disable it
- Try deployment, then re-enable protection

### Check 3: Complete Workflow Reset
1. **Delete ALL workflow files**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   rm -rf .github/workflows/github-pages.yml
   ```

2. **Create a simple test workflow**:
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/simple-deploy.yml
   name: Simple GitHub Pages Deploy
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write
   
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
           with:
             flutter-version: '3.24.3'
         - run: flutter pub get
         - run: flutter build web --release --base-href "/pet_addoption/"
         - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
           with:
             path: ./build/web
         - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
   ```

### Check 4: Alternative - Manual Branch Deployment
If GitHub Actions still fails, use manual branch deployment:
1. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release --base-href "/pet_addoption/"
   ```
2. **In GitHub Pages settings**:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/build/web`

## Expected Result 🎯
Your app will be available at: **https://Parthh08.github.io/pet_addoption/**
