# GitHub Actions Compatibility Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the GitHub Actions deployment issues.

## Problem
The project was failing GitHub Actions checks due to:
- Dart SDK version constraint `^3.7.2` was too restrictive
- Flutter version `3.19.0` in workflows was incompatible with newer dependencies
- Firebase workflows were missing Flutter build steps

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated pubspec.yaml
- **SDK constraint**: Changed from `^3.7.2` to `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0`
- **Flutter constraint**: Added `flutter: ">=3.10.0"`
- **Dependencies**: Reduced version constraints to be more compatible with older Dart/Flutter versions

### 2. Updated GitHub Workflows
- **Flutter version**: Updated from `3.19.0` to `3.24.3` in all workflows
- **Firebase workflows**: Added Flutter setup and build steps that were missing

### 3. Key Changes
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'
  flutter: ">=3.10.0"

# .github/workflows/*.yml
flutter-version: '3.24.3'
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Compatible with Dart SDK 3.3.0+ (common in CI environments)
- ✅ Works with Flutter 3.10.0+ (widely available)
- ✅ All GitHub Actions workflows now include proper build steps
- ✅ Maintains all app functionality while ensuring deployment compatibility

## Verification
- `flutter pub get` - Dependencies resolve correctly
- `flutter analyze` - No static analysis issues
- `flutter build web --release` - Builds successfully
- All workflows updated with consistent Flutter version

The app is now ready for deployment on GitHub Actions, Firebase Hosting, and GitHub Pages without SDK version conflicts.
